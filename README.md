🌱 Potato Leaf Disease Detection using Deep Learning
________________________________________________________

Overview

This project is an AI-powered system that detects potato leaf diseases using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). The model classifies leaves into three categories:

✅ Healthy

🛑 Early Blight

⚠️ Late Blight

A Streamlit web application is provided for easy access, allowing users to upload leaf images and receive instant predictions.
